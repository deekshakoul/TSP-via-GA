# TSP-via-GA
Implement TSP by using Genetic algorithm.

Representing the tour(one chromosome) by Path method and setting fixed population size, mutation and crossover probability; different cross-over and mutation techniques were implemented along with elitism to check the combination that returns most fittest tour i.e one with shortest distance.

Cross-overs implemented:
* Partially mapped crossover (PMX)
* Cycle crossover (CX)
* Order based Crossover (OX1, OX2)
* Maximal preservative crossover (MPX)
* Position based crossover (POS)
* Alternating-position crossover (AP)
- One point mutataion
- OX1 was better 
- ELitism helped
